# Plot network using JavaScript

This code explores how to draw a network using Python and JavaScript using the 
D3 library. This was adapted from:
https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/auto_examples/external/javascript_force.html

Running the script `plot.py` writes `force/graph.json` and then opening
http://localhost:8000 shows the network.
