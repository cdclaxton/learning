# A Python script to characterise the performance of the algorithm to find
# entities when one or more tokens of an entity may be missing in the text.
#
# Variables:
# - Number of tokens in the entities
# - Probability of a given number of tokens being dropped
# - Overlap between tokens used in entities and those in text

if __name__ == "__main__":
    pass

    # Initialise the results

    # Generate the entities

    # Create a lookup for the entities

    # Select one or more entities at random

    # Remove tokens at random from the entity or entities

    # Embed the entity tokens into surrounding text

    # Run the entity detectors on the text

    # Calculate the error

    # Plot the error
