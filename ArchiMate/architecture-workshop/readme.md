# Architecture Workshop

Fast-paced introduction to software architecture and modelling for software engineers, data engineers and data scientists to show how software modelling aids collaboration, encourages code reuse and provides standardised documentation.

Motivating example: 
- Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks generated by data engineers and data scientists for one-off tasks
- Data pipelines for ETL for persistent incoming data sources
- Data fusion
- End-user analytics tools

Audience:

- Software engineers:
    - where modelling fits into the software design and implementation process
    - benefits for considering modelling early in the design process
    - using designs for documentation
    - see modelling as helpful, not another task to do for a ticket
- Data engineers:
    - data modelling
    - documentation
- Data scientists:
    - reviewing the capability catalogue to find existing code
    - adding capability to existing catalogue

Topics to cover:

- Modelling versus drawing diagrams
- Tools:
    - Sparx EA
    - Archi
    - UML tools
- Introduction to Sparx Enterprise Architect
    - Purpose
    - Types of modelling notation that can be used
- Structuring a model
- ArchiMate
    - Capability modelling 
    - Implementation and migration
- UML
    - Use case diagrams
- Entity-relationship modelling (data modelling)

## Motivating example

## Modelling versus drawing

- Changing the name of a component in a model flows through to other views
- Ability to find linked components
