    "A discrete Bayesian network has two types of vertices: parent and child vertices. A parent vertex has a prior probability over its possible discrete states. A child vertex also has a set of states, but the conditional probability is defined by a conditional probability table (CPT).\n",

    "Consider a Bayesian network where each child vertex has a CPT, but instead the values being point values (e.g. 0.8), they are a uniform distribution. The presence of the uniform distributions makes it easier for an analysts to encode their uncertainty about their estimates in the knowledge elicitation phase.\n",
